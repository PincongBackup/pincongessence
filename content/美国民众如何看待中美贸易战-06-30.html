        <h1>美国民众如何看待中美贸易战？<br></h1><address>sam金&nbsp;<br></address><p>刚才看了纽约时报的一篇关于中美互征500亿关税的<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/us-china-tariffs-trade.html#commentsContainer" target="_blank">报道</a>：</p><p><br></p><p>我们来看看评论吧，选取最前面五则：</p><p><br></p><blockquote>Richard Huber New YorkJune 16 Times Pick As an owner of 5 vineyards &amp; a winery in Chile, with China far and away the largest market for our wines, I should be applauding the idiotic moves by our nincompoop-in-chief which have provoked reciprocal tariffs by China on American wine. On the contrary I am not, indeed I am very sad. We already are working our winery at full capacity 24 hours a day &amp; don’t need any more demand. But I am an American &amp; I seemingly care a lot more about our country than the nincompoop, who so mechanically shouts “America First” without the remotest understanding of how the international commerce world works.</blockquote><p>作为在智力有五家酒厂的我来说，中国是我们最大的市场，我应该认为这个行为是愚蠢的，我们的总统在中美酒制品之间加了关税。但是正相反，我不是这样，我很悲哀，我们酒厂已经24小时运转了而且不要更多的需求了，而且作为一个美国人，我更在乎我们的国家。</p><p><br></p><blockquote>&nbsp;MHW Chicago, ILJune 16 Times Pick While there are many, many areas of disagreement between the two major parties, free trade is an area of common ground. Trade wars are lose-lose endeavors. This is not smart. This is not strategic. This will do harm. So trumpian. So wrong.</blockquote><p>两党之间矛盾重重，但是自由贸易是两党共识。贸易战是双输的，这不聪明，也没有战略性，川粉们，错了。</p><p><br></p><blockquote>GTM Austin TXJune 16 Times Pick Trump and his GOP Congressional minions are handing the Dems a ready-built economic campaign issue with tariffs leading directly to decreased farm prices for exports and increased prices for consumer goods imported from China, Canada, Mexico and the EU. Add in the current GOP efforts to dismantle the ACA and their published plans to cut back on social safety net spending (SSI, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, et al) to "pay for" the recent $2 Trillion corporate tax cut, and the Dems are being handed the economic issues to take back Congress in the 2018 mid-term elections. Now lets see if the DNC can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory once again. 77 Recommend</blockquote><p>特朗普和他的共和党国会支持者将德姆斯交由现成的经济运动问题处理，关税直接导致出口农产品价格下降，以及从中国，加拿大，墨西哥和欧盟进口的消费品价格上涨。 在目前的GOP中，努力拆除ACA和他们公布的削减社会安全净支出（SSI，Medicare，Medicaid，SNAP等）以“支付”最近2万亿美元企业减税的计划以及Dems在2018年的中期选举中正在将经济问题交给国会。 现在让我们看看DNC是否可以再次从胜利的击败。</p><p><br></p><blockquote>&nbsp;Peter Daniel ChicagoJune 16 Times Pick Not many things I agree on with Trump, but he is absolutely right to go after China for their intellectual theft and and unfair trade practices. As anyone who has tried to do business in China will attest, they are ruthlessly dishonest. I still believe a much smarter approach would have been to match Chinese tariffs, ownership, and local content regulations one for one. Would be hard to argue against the fact that we are just matching what you are doing to us.</blockquote><p>我与特朗普达成共识的事情并不多，但他完全有理由追究中国的知识产权盗窃和不公平交易行为。 任何曾经试图在中国做生意的人都会证明，他们无情地不诚实。 我仍然相信一个更聪明的方法是一对一匹配中国关税，所有权和本地内容法规。我们很难反驳这样一个事实，即我们只是在匹配你对我们做的事情。</p><p><br></p><blockquote>&nbsp;Jack Toner Oakland, CAJune 16 Times Pick Too bad wed didn't line up our allies to form a common front against China, probably could have accomplished a lot. Instead Trump has alienated our allies, may, in fact, have started trade wars with them. Can we beat the whole world? Highly doubtful. But for now the Republican base is thrilled, "We'll show them!" they cry. Later on there'll be some real crying. 64 Recommend</blockquote><p>太糟糕的是，没有联合我们的盟友，在对付中国形成共同阵线，可能会取得很多成就。相反，特朗普已经疏远了我们的盟友，实际上，他们可能已经开始了与他们的贸易战。 我们能打败整个世界吗？非常值得怀疑。但现在共和党的粉丝很激动，“我们会向他们展示实力了！” 他们哭了。但是稍后他们会有一些真正的哭泣。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>资料来源: 品葱 </p><p><a href="https://www.pin-cong.com/p/97404/#!q_mt" target="_blank">https://www.pin-cong.com/p/97404/#!q_mt</a></p>
